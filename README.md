# ASP.NET Core GraphQL demo

In this repo you'll find a demo application of how to run [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) in an [ASP.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet?WT.mc_id=javascript-7131-aapowell).

For the GraphQL server, [`graphql-dotnet`](https://github.com/graphql-dotnet/graphql-dotnet) is used and it is deployed to [Azure App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/?WT.mc_id=javascript-7131-aapowell) using [GitHub Actions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/deploy-github-actions?WT.mc_id=javascript-7131-aapowell).

You can learn more about this project [on my blog](https://www.aaron-powell.com/posts/2020-07-21-graphql-on-azure-part-2-app-service-with-dotnet/).
